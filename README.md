Analyzed Kaggle's Target ecommerce dataset using MySQL and Python. Uploaded CSVs via Python script, then performed insightful data exploration in Jupyter Notebook through SQL queries and visualizations to uncover customer and sales trends.

The project involved creating interactive plots using Matplotlib and Seaborn to visualize monthly sales trends, customer distribution by state, and category-wise revenue insights. SQL queries were optimized for performance, and the entire workflow—from data ingestion to visualization—was built for reproducibility and scalability across larger ecommerce datasets.

This analysis offers actionable insights for ecommerce strategy, including identifying peak sales months and high-performing product categories. The project leverages SQL for structured queries, Python for automation and visualization, and Jupyter Notebook as an agile platform for exploratory data analysis, making it a versatile tool for both business intelligence and academic review.
